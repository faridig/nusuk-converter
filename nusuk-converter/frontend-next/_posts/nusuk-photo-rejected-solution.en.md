## Was your photo for the Nusuk app rejected? Don't panic.

Nothing is more frustrating than seeing a "photo rejected" message after trying to upload your documents. The good news is that the reason is often simple and very easy to fix.

Here is a checklist of the 5 most common reasons for photo rejection, and how to resolve them instantly.

### Checklist of Common Errors:

**1. The dimensions are not exactly 200x200 pixels.**
*   **The problem:** Your photo is rectangular (e.g., 400x500px) or square but not the right size.
*   **The quick solution:** Use the cropping tool in **Pilgrim Docs**. It provides a perfect square frame to adjust your photo.

**2. The file size is over 1 MB.**
*   **The problem:** Photos taken with modern smartphones are often very large (3-5 MB).
*   **The quick solution:** Our tool intelligently compresses your image to get it under the 1 MB limit while maintaining excellent quality.

**3. The background is not 100% white.**
*   **The problem:** The wall behind you might look white, but it could have shadows or a cream tint.
*   **The tip:** Take your photo in front of a well-lit white wall. If that's not possible, some online tools can help remove the background.

**4. Your face is too close or too far away.**
*   **The problem:** The rules require your face to take up a certain amount of space in the frame.
*   **The quick solution:** The cropping tool in **Pilgrim Docs** allows you to zoom and perfectly position your face in the center.

**5. The format is not .jpg.**
*   **The problem:** You might have a `.png`, `.heic` (from an iPhone), or another file type.
*   **The quick solution:** Our converter automatically saves your photo in the `.jpg` format, ready for Nusuk.

### The All-in-One Solution

Rather than juggling multiple tools, **Pilgrim Docs** does it all at once: cropping, compressing, and converting to the correct format.
