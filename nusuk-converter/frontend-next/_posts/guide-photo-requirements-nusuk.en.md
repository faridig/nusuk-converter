## Prepare for your pilgrimage without stress: master the Nusuk document requirements.

Registering on the Nusuk app is a crucial step for your Hajj or Umrah. But a small technical step can quickly become a headache: submitting photos and documents. A rejected photo can cause stress and delays.

This complete guide explains **all the official requirements** so your documents are accepted on the first try.

### 1. Requirements for the ID Photo (the 200x200 photo)

This is the strictest photo. It must meet the criteria of a passport photo.

*   **Dimensions:** Exactly **200 x 200 pixels**. This is non-negotiable.
*   **File size:** The weight must be less than **1 MB** (Megabyte).
*   **Format:** Only `.jpg` or `.jpeg`.
*   **Background:** The background must be **completely white**, with no shadows.
*   **Quality:** The photo must be sharp, not blurry.
*   **Attire and posture:**
    *   Look directly at the camera.
    *   Neutral expression, mouth closed.
    *   No glasses that cover the eyes.
    *   Your face must be fully visible.

### 2. Requirements for the Passport Copy

This refers to the main page of your passport, the one with your photo and information.

*   **Dimensions:** The recommended dimensions are approximately **400 pixels wide by 600 pixels high**.
*   **Content:** The entire page must be visible, with no fingers covering it.
*   **Readability:** All information (name, passport number, expiration date) must be perfectly legible.
*   **File size:** Also less than **1 MB**.

### 3. Requirements for Proof of Address (if required)

The requirements are similar to the passport: ensure the entire document is readable.
